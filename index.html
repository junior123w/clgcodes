        <h2>Start:</h2>
        <p>The <i>great lockdown </i>like everyone messed me up to not physically but mentally.
            I like to do things on my own and be independent and have my <u>own little space</u>,but when i got 
            in lockdown and had to share my space with others i found out that it started to affect me.
            Moreover there was also ongoing debate of wether <u>final exam would be taken or not</u>. All of this took
            a toll on my <b>mental health</b> so bad that it was hard to be cheery but u had to pretend that u are all
            happy as u dont want to make people around u worry.
        </p>
        <h3>What it affected: </h3>
        <p> In the beginning i was like that its only for a month or 2 and then everything will go back to normal
            but at that time i didnt knew that <u>i was so wrong</u>. Then slowly when online learning started i was like 
            what a <u>bunch of ...</u> it is as i like in-person more than online. So i basically stopped studying thinking 
            it wont affect my final grades as there is no way final exam would be taken and i was wrong here again.
            <u>Not only it affected my academic life it also affected my personal life and at that time i didnt have 
            friends who would listen to me ranting about it.</u>
        </p>
        <h4>Solution: </h4>
        <p><u>My great advice for u guys would be that 1st of all no matter how much alluring drinking smoking and
            anything else looks dont do it as short term gains are not worth long term losses</u>.I had very supportive
        teachers who supported me throughout even though it was <b>not a part of their job</b>. Well, there was a 
    blessing in disguise in all of this that i vetted out friends who would be with me when neede and those who jsut 
there for being there for namesake only 
<br><b>Moral:</b> There is always good things hidden in bad things so dont be discouraged by seeing a big mountain
in front of you.</br></p>
